Measuring angles
================

Introduction
------------
To measure angles on planes that are not orthogonal to the camera optical axis it is necessary to first perform :doc:`plane calibration </measurement/calibration>`.

The unit for angles can be configured in Preferences > Playback > Units. The options are Degrees (°) and Radians (rad).

Angle
----------
To measure an angle add an angle object and position its end points.

By default the angle runs counter-clockwise, starting from the dashed leg.
The context menu options let you switch between signed or unsigned angle, change from counter-clockwise to clockwise, and switch to supplementary angle.

Goniometer
-----------

The goniometer tool let you measure angles relatively to a reference angle.
This is generally used to compare extension or flexion of a body segment relatively to a baseline anatomical angle.
The dashed leg is locked to steps of 45°.

Angles relative to axes
-----------------------
The angle-to-horizontal and angle-to-vertical tools let you measure angles relatively to the horizontal or vertical axes.
