- frame by frame using the controls, the keyboard or the cursor on the main timeline.
- using page up/page down to move by larger chunks within the video.
- scroll wheel to move forward/backward.
- automatic lowering of playback speed if can't sustain framerate.
- what is impacting the performances of playback.
