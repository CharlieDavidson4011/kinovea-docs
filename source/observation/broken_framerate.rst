Broken frame rate
=================

TODO:

- menu Video > configure video timing, bottom of window.
- When should this be used?Â When file says it's at a particular framerate but it's wrong, or the framerate couldn't be read and it's defaulting to 25 fps.
- when not to use it? When the file is merely in slow motion due to high speed camera.
- What is this impacting ? It changes what 100% speed mean. It plays the file faster or slower for a given speed value. (Unlike capture framerate which just changes the *display* of the speed values).
